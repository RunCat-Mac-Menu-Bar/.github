## What is RunCat for Mac?

RunCat for Mac is a **lightweight and entertaining menu bar application** that displays an animated character (like a cat, dog, or bird) whose running speed changes based on your Mac's CPU usage. The higher the CPU load, the faster your chosen character runs. This provides a fun and visual way to monitor system performance without opening additional tools.

The app is designed to be minimalistic and resource-friendly, making it ideal for continuous use. It supports multiple animated characters and themes, allowing users to personalize their menu bar experience. Whether you're a developer, designer, or casual user, RunCat adds a touch of whimsy to your workflow while keeping you informed about system activity.

RunCat integrates seamlessly with **macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and earlier versions**, running efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Its simple interface ensures that anyone can install and use it immediately without any learning curve.
